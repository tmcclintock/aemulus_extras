This directory contains the linear power spectra for all simulations at all snapshots. The wavenumber k are also here, in the file `k.txt`.

Note the units: `k` is in Mpc^-1 and `P` is in Mpc^3.

Files for the highres simulations are TODO. The Medium-3Gpc and Big-9Gpc boxes overlap the testing simulations.
